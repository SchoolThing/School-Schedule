The School Schedule is something very important for students and something very hard for teachers to make!
There are a lot of things to think about while making it on hand.There are the subjects for every class,the rooms in which
they are going to be,the time the class starts and the correct teachers for that class.
This project will be something we are making to help the teachers with those choices.
